This post indroduce the basics of the EVM Algorithm. For details: [EVM](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/).

1. ###EVM Preview
   Evm is the abbreviation of *Eulerian Video Magnification*. According to the [paper](https://googledrive.com/host/0B6Io4fF4zXvDTnBFeXRBM0Vja3c/images/gsoc_Basics/vidmag.pdf), that:

   > Out method, which we call Eulerian Video Magnification, takes a standard video sequence as input, and applies spatial decoposition signal, followed by temporal filtering to the frames. The resulting signal is then amplified to reveal hidden information.
   
   And as it is said in the paper, that EVM **relies on a linear approximation related to the brightness contancy assumption used in optical flow**. As a result:

   > Using our method, we are able to visualize the flow of blood as it fills the face and also to amplify and reveal small motions.

   EVM is both applicable to *color variation* and *low-amplitude motion* but require different processing techniques.

   EVM is inspired by *Eulerian* perspective, which is in constrast to *Lagrangian* perspective.

   * For *Lagrangian* perspective, it is **in reference to fluid dynamics where the trajectory of particles is tracked over time**. And it **rely on accurate motion estimation** and other additional techniques, including **motion segmentation, image in-painting**, and are required to **produce good quality synthesis**.

   * In contrast, for *Eulerian* perspective, it is **properties of a voxel of fluid, such as pressure and velocity, evolve over time**. **We amplify the variation of pixel values over time, in a spatially-multiscale manner**. **We do not explicityly estimate motion, but rather exaggerate motion by amplifying temporal color changes at fixed position**.

   In a word, *Eulerian* perspective is a easier mothod.

   * First, we do spatial frequency decomposition. For each band they might be magnified differently because:
      * They might exhibit different S/N ratios.
      * They might contain spatial frequencies for which the linear approximation used in the motion magnification does not hold.
       
     If the goal of spatial processing is simply to increase temporal S/N ratio by pooling multiple pixels, we spatially low-pass filter the frames of the video and simply downsample them for computational efficiency.  
   
   * Second, There are four steps to take for each spatial frequency bands:
  
     * Select a temporal bandpass filter
     * Select an amplification factor, \\( \alpha \\).
     * Select a spatial frequency cutoff (specified by spatial wavelength \\( \lambda_c \\) beyond which an attenuated version of \\( \alpha \\) is used.
     * Select the form of the attenuation for \\( \alpha \\)-either force \\( \alpha \\) to zero for all \\( \lambda < \lambda_c \\), or linearly scale \\( \alpha \\) down to zero.
    
   * Third, adding the magnified signal to the original and collapse the spatial pyramid will get us to the final result. 
     
     
    One thing to figure out, **Since natural videos are spatially and temporally smooth, and since filtering is persormed uniformly over the pixels, the method implicitly maintains spatiotemporal coherency**.

   Spatial decomposition is the standard process of *building Gussian pyramid* or *Laplace pyramid*.
