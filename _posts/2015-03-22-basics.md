This post indroduce the basics of the EVM Algorithm. For details: [EVM](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/).

+ ### EVM Preview 

Evm is the abbreviation of *Eulerian Video Magnification*. According to the [paper](https://googledrive.com/host/0B6Io4fF4zXvDTnBFeXRBM0Vja3c/images/gsoc_Basics/vidmag.pdf), that:

> Out method, which we call Eulerian Video Magnification, takes a standard video sequence as input, and applies spatial decoposition signal, followed by temporal filtering to the frames. The resulting signal is then amplified to reveal hidden information.

And as it is said in the paper, that EVM **relies on a linear approximation related to the brightness contancy assumption used in optical flow**. As a result:

> Using our method, we are able to visualize the flow of blood as it fills the face and also to amplify and reveal small motions.

EVM is both applicable to *color variation* and *low-amplitude motion* but require different processing technique.

EVM is inspired by *Eulerian* perspective, which is in constrast to *Lagrangian* perspective.

For *Lagrangian* perspective, it is **in reference to fluid dynamics where the trajectory of particles is tracked over time**. And it **rely on accurate motion estimation** and other additional techniques, including **motion segmentation, image in-painting**, and are required to **produce good quality synthesis**.

In contrast, for *Eulerian* perspective, it is **properties of a voxel of fluid, such as pressure and velocity, evolve over time**.
